# Rule Syntax

## What is YAML?

YAML is a data serialization language that is often used for writing configuration files. Depending on whom you ask, YAML stands for yet another markup language or YAML ain’t markup language (a recursive acronym), which emphasizes that YAML is for data, not documents. 

YAML has the suffixes `.yaml`, `.yml`, but TIS currently only recognises `.yaml` rule files.

## Rules folder
In the project folder `/tweaks`

## Naming Rules

The exact rules are to be determined, for now you can use the existing configuration file for naming.

You must use capital letters at the beginning and no spaces or non-English characters in the file name.

Please do not use meaningless names such as `111111`, `aaaaa`, `fje9fhj9e` or other plain or garbled characters.

## Syntax

### Example

```yaml
# Basic Information
meta:
  en:
    name: name
    desc: desc (Optional)
    from: origin (Optional)
  zh:
    作用: 作用
    介绍: 简介 (可选)
    来源: 来源 (可选)
# Apply to all new user
applyDefaultUser: true
tweaks:
  # Registry Rules
  registry:
    - key: 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Feeds' # Registry Key Name
      valueName: "ShellFeedsTaskbarViewMode" # Registry Value Name
      type: "REG_DWORD" # Type of key
      value: "2" # Value
    - key:
      valueName: 'HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{323CA680-C24D-4099-B94D-446DD2D7249E}\ShellFolder'
      action: delete # Action for delete
  # Rules of operation
  run:
    - command: "dism /Online /Set-ReservedStorageState /State:Disabled" # Run command
      action: cmd # Action
    - command: "powercfg.exe /hibernate off" # Run command
      action: cmd # Action
      showWindow: true # Display window
      defaultApplyMode: desktop # Apply Mode
    - command: 'Disable-ComputerRestore -Drive "$env:SYSTEMDRIVE"' # Run command
      action: pwsh # Action
      defaultApplyMode: all # Apply Mode
```

### meta

This is where some basic information is written to `config.ini` to indicate what the rule is used for, what to look for, side effects, sources, etc. It is written to `config.ini` at compile time.

#### meta.\<lang\>.\<string\>

`lang` is the standard language code, string is an arbitrary string

Example: Basic information in Chinese

```yaml
meta:
  zh:
    作用: 作用
    介绍: 简介
    来源: 来源
```

Example: Basic information in English and Chinese, and the most basic way to use it

```yaml
meta:
  en:
    name: name
    desc: desc (Optional)
    from: origin (Optional)
  zh:
    作用: 作用
    介绍: 简介 (可选)
    来源: 来源 (可选)
```

### applyDefaultUser

Apply the rule to all new users, i.e. write to the new user's registry, only for registry rules with root `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`.

After setting this item, all registry roots as `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` will be written to the new user's registry at the same time during the Sysprep process.

Whether this key is set or not, relevant rules will also be written to the registry in the desktop environment

Example: To apply the current rule to all new user set the key to `true`.

```yaml
applyDefaultUser: true
```

Example: You can delete the key or set it to `false` if you don't need it

```yaml
applyDefaultUser: false
```

### tweaks

Tweaking, setting rules, and also configuration that affects the operating system

#### tweaks.registry

Registry Rules

##### tweaks.registry.\<rules\>

The available keys are :

- key: registry key name (path) (required)
- valueName: registry key name (required) (optional if action is delete)
- type: type of key (required) (optional if action is delete)
- value: Value (required) (optional if action is delete)
- action: Action (optional)

Type of key, value:

- key: string
- valueName: string
- type: "REG_SZ" | "REG_MULTI_SZ" | "REG_EXPAND_SZ" | "REG_DWORD" | "REG_QWORD" | "REG_BINARY"
- value: string
- action: "delete"

`type` value supports `REG_SZ`, `REG_MULTI_SZ`, `REG_EXPAND_SZ`, `REG_DWORD`, `REG_QWORD`, `REG_BINARY`

`action` value only supports `delete`, then only delete actions are supported

Example: Create and modified registry values

```yaml
tweaks:
  registry:
    - key: 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Feeds'
      valueName: "ShellFeedsTaskbarViewMode"
      type: "REG_DWORD"
      value: "2"
```

Example: Create and modify multiple registry values

```yaml
tweaks:
  registry:
    - key: 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\CTF\LangBar'
      valueName: "ShowStatus"
      type: "REG_DWORD"
      value: "4"
    - key: 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\CTF\LangBar'
      valueName: "ExtraIconsOnMinimized"
      type: "REG_DWORD"
      value: "0"
		- key: 'HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shellex\-ContextMenuHandlers\Offline Files'
      valueName: ""
      type: "REG_SZ"
      value: "{474C98EE-CF3D-41f5-80E3-4AAB0AB04301}"
```

Example: Deleting the registry

```yaml
tweaks:
  registry:
    - key: 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run'
      valueName: "OneDriveSetup"
      action: delete
		- key: 'HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers\Offline Files'
      action: delete
```

#### tweaks.run

Run rules, you can run any cmd, powershell command and any program

<Callout type="warning">
  Do not run any commands here that require interaction and may result in an interrupted window!
</Callout>

##### tweaks.run.\<rules\>

The available keys are:

- command: The command to be run (required)
- action: How to run (optional)
- showWindow: Whether to show the running program window (optional)
- defaultApplyMode: Application scenario (optional)

Type of key, value:

- command: string
- action: "cmd" | "pwsh"
- showWindow: boolean
- defaultApplyMode: "sysprep" | "desktop" | "all"

`showWindow` is whether to show the running program window, leave it blank or default to not show (false)

`action` is the command run mode, leave blank or default is `cmd`, `pwsh` is PowerShell

The internal run command is.

```bat
cmd:
cmd /c <command>

PowerShell:
powershell -command <command>
```

`defaultApplyMode` is the run mode, `sysprep` is executed in "Sysprep" only, `desktop` is executed in "desktop environment" only, `all` will be executed in "Sysprep" and "desktop environment", i.e. executed twice

Example: Run a command

```yaml
tweaks:
  run:
    - command: "powercfg.exe /hibernate off"
```

Example: Run multiple commands, one using PowerShell

```yaml
tweaks:
  run:
    - command: "powercfg.exe /hibernate off"
    - command: 'Disable-ComputerRestore -Drive "$env:SYSTEMDRIVE"'
      action: pwsh
```

Example: Run multiple commands, one using PowerShell, and only in the desktop environment, while displaying the command run window

```yaml
tweaks:
  run:
    - command: "powercfg.exe /hibernate off"
    - command: 'Disable-ComputerRestore -Drive "$env:SYSTEMDRIVE"'
      action: pwsh
      defaultApplyMode: desktop
      showWindow: true
```
