# Configuration

The configuration file is called `config.ini` and is usually located in the same directory as the main TIS program (tis.exe).

The configuration file determines which tuning rules are applied when the program is run.

Example:
```ini
[DisableFristLoginInstallOD]
; name: First login not install OneDrive
; from: internet
; name: 禁止首次开机启动时安装 OneDrive
apply=1 
applyDefaultUser=1
```

* apply: Apply this tweak
* applyDefaultUser: Apply all user (new user)

`0` or leave blank is `false` (disable), `1` is `true` (enable)

<Callout type="warning">
  TIS is not compatible with boolean values (true,false), please use numeric values
